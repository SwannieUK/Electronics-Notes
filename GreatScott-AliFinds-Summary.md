| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 1 | **5V Supercapacitor Power Filter Cube**       | ~€30          | ✅ **Good**       | Reduces noise from power supplies and works well for low-power filtering or buffering, but voltage drops at higher current draw. DIY alternatives may be cheaper. |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 2 | **Water Flow Hydro Generator**                | ~€10          | ❌ **Junk**       | Produced only ~0.38 W - far below advertised performance of 1.1W ( 140mA @ 2.8v ) - unsuitable for charging devices or powering projects.                |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 3 | **Drill-Powered Water Pump**                  | ~€19          | ❌ **Junk**       | Couldn’t pump water from even a shallow pond; too weak for practical use.                                                   |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 4 | **Drill-Powered Jigsaw Attachment**           | ~€12          | 👍 **Good**      | Works surprisingly well for small woodcuts; needs both hands and proper work clamping.                                           |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 5 | **Drill-Powered Chainsaw Attachment**         | ~€18          | ⭐ **Great**      | Assembles easily, cuts strongly, and performs far better than expected for the price.                                       |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 6 | **3A Lithium Battery Charger (IP2312-based)** | ~€0.70        | 🌟 **Excellent** | Efficient, cool-running, and accurate charging — a clear upgrade over the TP4056 boards.                                    |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 7 | **20W Hand Crank Generator**                  | ~€43          | ⚠️ **Poor**      | Output was under 8 W before the crank broke; poorly built despite a decent internal design.                                 |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 8 | **Anti-Spy RF Signal Detector**               | ~€20          | ❌ **Junk**       | Failed to reliably detect any signals; essentially a beeping box with limited real function.                                |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 1 | **Schumann Generator (7.8 Hz Coil Board)**           | ~€9           | ❌ **Junk**       | Emits a 7.8 Hz signal with no measurable benefit—just a blinking LED and marketing nonsense.                  |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 2 | **Ideal Diode Board (Metal Core)**                   | ~€13          | 👍 **Good**      | Works efficiently above 9 V with negligible voltage drop, useful for solar setups but useless for rectifiers. |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 3 | **12 V Wind Generator Kit (with MPPT Controller)**   | ~€235         | ❌ **Junk**       | Completely failed to charge a battery even at high wind speeds despite solid build quality.                   |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 4 | **Flying Pen (Enamel Wire Dispenser)**               | ~€13          | ✅ **Good**       | After some practice it’s a handy niche tool for SMD soldering with fine enamel wire.                          |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 5 | **Portable Spot Welder (Integrated 5.3 Ah Battery)** | ~€21          | 🌟 **Excellent** | Performs strong welds reliably, decent build quality, and great low-cost alternative to premium welders.      |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 6 | **DIY Makita Battery Pack Kit**                      | ~€17          | 👍 **Good**      | Easy to assemble and fully compatible with Makita tools—recommended if you already have spare cells.          |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 7 | **IP2368 Mini 100 W Power Bank PCB**                 | ~€25          | ⚠️ **Poor**      | Failed dramatically under load (blew up); missing proper power regulation unlike its larger version.          |
