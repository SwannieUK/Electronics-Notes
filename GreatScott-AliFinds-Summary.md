| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 3 | **Drill-Powered Water Pump**                  | ~€19          | ❌ **Junk**       | Couldn’t pump water from even a shallow pond; too weak for practical use.                                                   |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 4 | **Drill-Powered Jigsaw Attachment**           | ~€12          | 👍 **Good**      | Works surprisingly well for small woodcuts; needs both hands and proper work clamping.                                           |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 5 | **Drill-Powered Chainsaw Attachment**         | ~€18          | ⭐ **Great**      | Assembles easily, cuts strongly, and performs far better than expected for the price.                                       |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 6 | **3A Lithium Battery Charger (IP2312-based)** | ~€0.70        | 🌟 **Excellent** | Efficient, cool-running, and accurate charging — a clear upgrade over the TP4056 boards.                                    |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 7 | **20W Hand Crank Generator**                  | ~€43          | ⚠️ **Poor**      | Output was under 8 W before the crank broke; poorly built despite a decent internal design.                                 |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 8 | **Anti-Spy RF Signal Detector**               | ~€20          | ❌ **Junk**       | Failed to reliably detect any signals; essentially a beeping box with limited real function.                                |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 1 | **Schumann Generator (7.8 Hz Coil Board)**           | ~€9           | ❌ **Junk**       | Emits a 7.8 Hz signal with no measurable benefit—just a blinking LED and marketing nonsense.                  |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 2 | **Ideal Diode Board (Metal Core)**                   | ~€13          | 👍 **Good**      | Works efficiently above 9 V with negligible voltage drop, useful for solar setups but useless for rectifiers. |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 3 | **12 V Wind Generator Kit (with MPPT Controller)**   | ~€235         | ❌ **Junk**       | Completely failed to charge a battery even at high wind speeds despite solid build quality.                   |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 4 | **Flying Pen (Enamel Wire Dispenser)**               | ~€13          | ✅ **Good**       | After some practice it’s a handy niche tool for SMD soldering with fine enamel wire.                          |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 5 | **Portable Spot Welder (Integrated 5.3 Ah Battery)** | ~€21          | 🌟 **Excellent** | Performs strong welds reliably, decent build quality, and great low-cost alternative to premium welders.      |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 6 | **DIY Makita Battery Pack Kit**                      | ~€17          | 👍 **Good**      | Easy to assemble and fully compatible with Makita tools—recommended if you already have spare cells.          |
| 2 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 7 | **IP2368 Mini 100 W Power Bank PCB**                 | ~€25          | ⚠️ **Poor**      | Failed dramatically under load (blew up); missing proper power regulation unlike its larger version.          |
| 14 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 1 | **Metal Repair Glue (Two-Part “Welding Alternative”)** | ~€2.7         | ✅ **Good**   | Surprisingly strong for a cheap epoxy; not a welding replacement, but excellent for tough adhesive jobs.            |
| 14 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 2 | **Touch Sensor Switch (Behind-Surface LED Control)**   | ~€3.4         | 🌟 **Great** | Works flawlessly even through thick surfaces; ideal for hidden lighting control with solid circuit design.          |
| 14 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 3 | **Tweezer Soldering Station (Hot Tweezers, 37 €)**     | ~€37          | ⚠️ **OK**    | Heats fast and removes components easily, but lacks precision and reusability — fine for rough work only.           |
| 14 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 4 | **240 W USB-C Power Display Adapter**                  | ~€2.5         | 🌟 **Great** | Works accurately above 100 W and turns any USB-C cable into a power-measuring one; compact and reliable.            |
| 14 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 5 | **Mini Digital Torque Wrench**                         | ~€62          | 👍 **Good**  | Performs accurately and easily, though not premium quality — a solid affordable option for high-current work.       |
| 14 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=   | 6 | **Digital Laser Level (Manual Spirit Level Type)**     | ~€23          | ❌ **Junk**   | Beautiful build but poor accuracy and cumbersome manual leveling make it impractical compared to auto-level models. |
