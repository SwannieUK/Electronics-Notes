| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 1 | **5V Supercapacitor Power Filter Cube**       | ~€30          | ✅ **Good**       | Reduces noise from power supplies and works well for low-power filtering or buffering, though DIY alternatives are cheaper. |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 2 | **Water Flow Hydro Generator**                | ~€10          | ❌ **Junk**       | Produced only ~0.38 W—far below advertised performance—unsuitable for charging devices or powering projects.                |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 3 | **Drill-Powered Water Pump**                  | ~€19          | ❌ **Junk**       | Couldn’t pump water from even a shallow pond; too weak for practical use.                                                   |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 4 | **Drill-Powered Jigsaw Attachment**           | ~€12          | 👍 **Good**      | Works surprisingly well for small woodcuts; needs both hands and proper clamping.                                           |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 5 | **Drill-Powered Chainsaw Attachment**         | ~€18          | ⭐ **Great**      | Assembles easily, cuts strongly, and performs far better than expected for the price.                                       |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 6 | **3A Lithium Battery Charger (IP2312-based)** | ~€0.70        | 🌟 **Excellent** | Efficient, cool-running, and accurate charging — a clear upgrade over the TP4056 boards.                                    |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 7 | **20W Hand Crank Generator**                  | ~€43          | ⚠️ **Poor**      | Output was under 8 W before the crank broke; poorly built despite a decent internal design.                                 |
| 1 | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUdlfc1nJcY   | 8 | **Anti-Spy RF Signal Detector**               | ~€20          | ❌ **Junk**       | Failed to reliably detect any signals; essentially a beeping box with limited real function.                                |
